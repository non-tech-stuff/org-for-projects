# org-for-projects
Basic organization for all projects

## Why
A conversation...

_Good, just made a organizational structure for all projects._
I don't have any time table, all my activity is based on relevant project play (aka work ðŸ˜‚).

Relevant project example - if I'm having trouble with something I do, or need to automate stuff (food cooking for example).

I create a project and keep playing to keep it updated.

This way all projects progress, and without any bordedom <-- relevance. ðŸ‘€

## How
Simply said, all projects are version controlled.

There are 2 folders and one file.

- progress folder
- src, source code
- README.md

progress for recording all goals and thought process, including changes in thought process.

Code to implement it in the real world.

README for the why, how and what about the project. Helps me/others know what the project is about.

## What
A simple organization style for all my projects
